# PSNanoDHCPServ

***This script doesn't work yet.***

PSNanoDHCPServ is a very tiny and uncommonlyÂ DHCP server as a "Rescue Tool".

## Description

This server only works to send the network settings to a part of PCs into Network without any other DHCP servers.
Therefore this server *doesn't* have many functions that other servers have. 
I assume that this server should be terminated quickly after use(after sending the network settings to a target PC).

## Usage

*You must run this script as administrator.*

## Requirement

PowerShell 2.0 or later

# PSNanoDHCPServ

***This script doesn't work yet.***

PSNanoDHCPServ is a very tiny and uncommonlyÂ DHCP server as a "Rescue Tool".

## Description

This server only works to send the network settings to a part of PCs into Network without any other DHCP servers.
Therefore this server *doesn't* have many functions that other servers have.
And this server *doesn't* compliant exactlry with [RFC2131](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2131.txt).

I assume that this server would used temporalily and should be terminated quickly after use(after sending the network settings to a target PC).
